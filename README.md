# Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS
# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this course we learned about AI in general and applied some of those concepts to building intelligent agents to solve certain problems such as the cartpole experiment and navigating a trasure maze.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
#What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist find innovative solutions societies problems using technology. The AI models that I used in this course were used to solve games but by using these same principles I can create a generalized neural model to help solve more seriouse issues.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I first have to analyze the situation to understand the end goal and break it down into smaller pieces. I should then try to find a general reusable solution so that it can be utilized across a range of problems in that category. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibities are to consider the overall impact of my solution on socity. Just because I create something for a good reason doesn't mean that it will always be used for that purpose so I need to ensure that the proper safe guards are in place or that the right people have access to my products.
